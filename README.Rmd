The goal of stanmd is to collect some random Stan functions that I have written historically.
The Stan team has provided some amazing [resources](https://mc-stan.org/rstantools/articles/minimal-rstan-package.html) for developing packages that use Stan code.
This started as a demo just to understand how to do this.
Likely, I will move some additional Stan work into this. 
However, all of this work is experimental at this point in time.

## Installation

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("medewitt/stanmd")
```

## Example
